Descriptive statistics can be summarized in 2 ways
1. Central Tendency - where is the concentation of the data.
    mean - population mean and sample mean.
        sensitive to outliers.
    median - value at the center of the sample, not sensitive to outliers.
    mode - most common value in the sample, useful for categorial data.
2. Spread/Dispersion - how far apart the data are.
    range - max(sample) - min(sample)
        sensitive to outliers. not descriptive to show how the samples relate to the centroid.
    mean-based
        variance
            average squared distance from the mean. sigma squared is the population variance, s^2 is the sample variance.
            when calculating for the s^2, use n-1 as the divisor (bessel's correction).
        standard deviation
            square root of variance.
        coefficien of variance  - CV
            compare dispersion of one data set to another
    median based
        IQR - Inter Quantile Range 
            IQR = Q3-Q1, measure of data concentration around the median
        Quartile Coeffient of Dispersion    
            similar to CV

Histogram
    for discrete data set 
KDE - Kernel Density Estimates 
    for continous data set 
    estimate of PDF (Probability Density Function)
CDF - Cumulative Density Function
    P(X <= x) 

Distribution Types

Gaussian/Normal
    - if mean=0 and sd=1, its standard normal (Z) Distribution
Poisson
    - discrete distribution, use to model arrivals
    Exponential
        - time between arrivals
    both defined by their mean, lambda.
Uniform
    -equal Probability on each value within its bounds.
    bernoulli trial - generate random number to simulate a pass/fail. When run multiple times, it becomes binomial.

Normalization
min-max - range of 0-1
z-score - value refers to standard deviation from the mean. For example, a zscore of -0.5 mean its 0.5SD below the mean.
